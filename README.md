# Futoshiki-Puzzle-Game

AUTHORS:Parris Edwards McNairn

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
On the starting of the game a menu is displayed where the player is able to choose from three difficulties; easy, medium, hard and extreme. Once the player has chosen a difficulty a futoshiki grid is displayed with randomly generated numbers and constraints in the grid. The largest number displayed in the grid will never be larger than the size of the grid. For example, if the grid is 5 by 5 the largest number that will be in the grid is five. The constraints in the grid are more than ‘>’, ‘V’ and less than ‘<’, ‘^’. At the bottom of the futoshiki puzzle is a menu of buttons; the back button allows the user to go back the main menu of the game if they would like to choose a different difficulty and the new game button that allows the user to create a new futoshiki puzzle game of the same difficulty.

*Display the data:*
The futoshiki squares are displayed as text areas and the constraints are displayed as labels. The menu at the bottom of the futoshiki puzzle are displayed as two buttons.
